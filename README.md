Bootstrap Exercise

## For this exercise I created 3 pages of my portfolio- a contact form, an "About Me", and a portfolio. I used code from Bootstrap to create the navbar, buttons and images. An additional CSS page was added for certain styling, like including the background image. Semantic HTML was used and the media view was checked to make sure it was suitably visible on all devices.
